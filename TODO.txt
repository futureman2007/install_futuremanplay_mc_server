# TODO 
  #   - add public-key to authenticate as minecraft user or password.
  #     REQUIREMENTS: This playbook assumes, that the public_key/password to auth as ansible user is already installed.
  #                   It also assumes, that there is a user "ansible" with root rights to create a new user and install new packages"
  #   - add password to unzip in ansible-vault var file and refer to it to decrypt zip files
  #   - implement role to also set cronjob with @reboot sleep10; /usr/bin/screen -A -m -d -S minecraft /home/minecraft/minecraft-server/vanilla/ServerStart.sh
  #   - do a handler (what fits better) to stop and restart the server. So this playbook can also be used to update the existing plugins.
  #     for that, see notify handlers (notify, if the plugins zip has changed. Use the folder name with a date. if this folder name  does not exist, (like plugins-20-01-2024)
  #     then there is an update of plugins or a new install. in anyway: if the handler sees: "oh! minecraft is running, sop and start it ")
  #   -  Add in Readme to use --ask-vault-pass for installing server scripts (and that you also need to specify them)
